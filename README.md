TODO:
- Unhandlded json encode/decodes
- handle INVALID_SESSION opcode -> mostly done
- change consts and struct naming
- handle non-existing GuildStates in handle dispatch -> i think my solution is ok
- add Gateway Reconnect that tries to preserve guild states
- add Gateway Close
- add SIGINT handling (need to close websockets)
- unclear what happens when user manually drags bot into a different channel
    - when is voice server update event sent? -> when moved to a different channel, either by moderator or by bot itself
    - when should voice gateway be reconnected (not resumed)? -> after a pair of voice server/state update events are received with a non-nil channel
    - what session id, token, and url should voice gateway use on resume/reconnect? -> same session id, token, and url used on first connect
- send channel leave when startVoiceGw fails?
- rename *_consts.go files
